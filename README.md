# Machine Learning Course
Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying onpatterns and inference instead. 

Before using Machine learning algorithms we have to clasify and structure the data. Once of the highly used package for analysing and classifying the data is pandas

## Pandas
Pandas, allows you to get acquainted with your data by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing it. Primary two components of pandas are 

### Series
    A Series is just a structured column data
### DataFrame  
    A Multi dimentional table made up of collection of Series
